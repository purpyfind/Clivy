# Clivy // Reclyde

A Discord bot and revival of Discord's Clyde AI, with more features.
This bot is currently a friend testing project and is not going public anytime soon.

# How it works
This bot utilizes Gemini (Model: 1.5 Flash), which is an AI chatbot created by Google. It uses system instructions to tweak the bot to act like Clyde: the initial prompt is from Clyde itself, but may not be accurate.
